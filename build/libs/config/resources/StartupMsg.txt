Meep? Meep? MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP
Why do i do this?
Fun fact: this is a console app.
1.5k Lines of code, not really impressive, but its something.
Fun fact: this is not a gui app, although it has a messagebox command to show a messagebox...
Linux = Better, Windows = more compatibility
If I knew how to get JavaFX working, I wouldn't of used Swing for the messagebox.
